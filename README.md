# restaurantmenu
A restaurant menu interface I created, with demo products, that acts like a menu and checkout to let the user understand what they ordered and the cost.
Relies on user input & data validation inorder to keep the program running smoothly. 
This is all a mock demo, and can be swapped out for other uses. (Created in Colab, notebook).
